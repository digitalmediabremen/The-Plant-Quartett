#### Sine Wave
- hard to tell where the sound comes from

#### AM (Amplitude Modulation)
- AM is like ring modulation but with a subtle difference: the modulator is unipolar, that is, always positive. Think of tremolo, where the amplitude goes up and down (but is never negative!).

#### Granular Synthesis[After Tuesday]
- In Granular Synthesis sounds are modeled out of microscopic particles of sound, short grains in the region of 10-100
 milliseconds long.
- great for ambience sounds
- adding clouds?
