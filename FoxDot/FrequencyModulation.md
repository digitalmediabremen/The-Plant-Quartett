### Frequency Modulation

- FM comes into play when you use one wave to modulate another wave
- Modulator(operator) - Carrier
- 'Ratio' refer to the frequencies between the waves that are involved.

FM is a family of methods that share the common property of wavetable lookup according to a nonlinear oscillating function.

### Background
- Applications of FM in communications systems date back to 19th century while the theory behind FM of radio band frequencies was established in the early 20th century.
- John Chowning: the first to explore systematically the musical potential of digital FM synthesis. Prior to this, most digital sound had been produced by fixed-waveform, fixed-spectrum techniques, because time-varying synthesis were rare and costly.
-> generate synthetic sounds that had the animated spectra characteristic of natural sounds. (extreme vibrato techniques)

#### C:M ratio
- C-5M, C-4M, C-3M, C-2M, C-M, C, C+M, C+2M, C+3M, C+4M, C+5M
- when C:M is a simple integer ratio, such as 4:1, FM generates harmonic spectra
- when C:M is not a simple integer ratio, such as 8:2.1, FM generates inharmonic spectra

#### Modulation Index and Bandwidth
- The bandwidth of the FM spectrum (the number of sidebands) is controlled by the modulation index or index of modulation I. I is defined mathematically by:
I = D/M
