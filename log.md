#### FoxDot and Supercollider
- FoxDot is written using Python and Tkinter(UI)
- [Supercollider tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRzsOOiJ_p4)
- [Supercollider class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyAsr4FSJKs), [Syllabus](https://uofi.app.box.com/s/dw9sxedm8czj3wk2t3howw15lf8fepul)
- foxdot's scsyn is defined here: https://github.com/Qirky/FoxDot/blob/master/FoxDot/osc/scsyndef/

#### Remarks
- FoxDot's Data manipulation is super useful, kind of painful to do similar things in super Supercollider

### Circuit
- Now got some basic reading from a simple GSR
- A GSR function with an amplifier[https://www.1010.co.uk/org/biologic.html]
- I got the wheatstone bridge diagram from Anika and ordered the parts that I need online (See:Wheatstone Bridge Circuit)
- I also want to try Anika's circuit based on professional measurements in the future, but for now I can focus more on the sound part of the project.
