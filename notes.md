### Research

#### Scott, Bruce I. H., "Electricity in Plants", Scientific American, Oct. 1962, S. 107-115
[p107]
- "Electrical disturbances similar to the nerve impulse are associated with a number of plant life processes. It seems likely that these currents and fields somehow influence plant growth and development"

[p110]
- "The root of a bean shoot growing a weakly conductive medium, for example, is found to act as an electric generator sending tiny current into the medium and back through the root"…
- "The instrumentation must be highly sensitive, because only about a hunderdth of a microampere flows across a square millimeter of root surface" …
- "Without any stimulation the potential near the root starts to oscillate in a rhythmic fashion, the oscillations continuing for perhaps several hours […] The periods of oscillation for the roots we have studied are about five minutes. "
-  solutions of potassium chloride or sodium chloride

p[113]
- "the feedback loop that is the genius of the automatic-control revolution in contemporary technology is really an adaptation of a universal principle that makes living systems self-regulating."
- plant hormone: "indoleacetic acid may provide the feedback linkage that in turn controls the distribution of the hormone"

- "The demonstration in a lower organism of a feedback system with characteristic periods of oscillation is of interest in still another connection. This is the time sense, or 'biological clock' of such organism."
p[114]

Two major directions:
#### Bio Electrocity
Very subtle? But I would like to try measure bio-electricity from roots in water(solutions). But this is definitely something very fragile and not easy to take. Any way to do this in a more compact way?


micro-voltages (is action potential?) (and question of response to electromagnetic waves/fields eg. Lawrence, Experiments in Electroculture)

#### Bioelectrical Impedance

Project Examples
- [midiSprout](https://www.midisprout.com/):  Galvanic Conductance + ATmega328(8 bits) [details](https://www.instructables.com/Biodata-Sonification/)
- [SCÍON](https://www.instruomodular.com/product/scion/): a biofeedback sensor(biofeedback data, sourced from contact with organic surfaces) built into a quad random voltage generator. Based on the MidiSprout by Datagarden

- [Arduino Project by mwlyon](http://www.mwlyon.com/design_services_pages/arduino_projects.html): AD5933
