## The Plant Quartett

The Plant Quartett is a sound project that provides an ambient listening experience of plants by using multiple Soniplasts, a self-designed instrument that translates biodata from plants into music. Similar as Chloroplasts, which are organelles that conduct photosynthesis in plants, a Soniplast takes bioelectric potential data from a plant and translates it into sound. The hardware is based on the Teensy boards and it uses the Teensy Audio Library for sound design. By having multiple Soniplasts, the Plant Quartett pays attention to the relative differences in rhythmic cycles among plants and how they contribute together to a musical composition. The objective of the project is to encourage an intimate yet playful relationship with plants in a slow, subtle and collective manner.
