The Plant Quartet is a sound installation that provides an ambient listening experience of plants by using multiple Soniplasts, a custom-designed instrument that translates biodata from plants into sound. Similar as Chloroplasts, which are organelles that conduct photosynthesis in plants, a Soniplast takes bioelectric potential data from a plant and translates it to sound by using the signal to modulate a simple sine wave.

The installation puts plants at the centre of the focus: they react to the environment but in a slow and subtle manner, which is very different from the time scale and ways of perception of animals/human. The project pays attention to the relative differences in rhythmic cycles among plants and how they contribute together to a musical composition. By amplifying the ubiquitous existence of plants through sound, the objective of the project is to encourage an intimate relationship with plants in a slow, subtle and collective manner.
