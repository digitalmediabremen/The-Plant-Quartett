## plantSonification
[Title] is a project that aims to provide a less tonal listening experience of plants. It takes plants' natural behavior as input without deliberate human interference and translates it into an ambient musical experience. Itâ€™s not just about one plant, but how different kinds of plants differ in their rhythmic cycles and contribute together to a musical composition. Through this listening experience, the project encourages a more intimate relationship with plants in a slow, subtle and collective manner.

### Plan
1. Experiments: choice of sensor

2. Sound production
Sound production first in software then in hardware

3. Final Compositions/Performance
